    <div class="answer">
      On Friday evening, anyone in attendance can suggest
      topics for sessions held the following day. The
      suggester indicates whether it is a topic they'd like to
      present on, hold a group discussion on, or learn more about. After
      all the suggestions have been written down, they are placed on
      a wall and attendees mark the topics they are interested
      in. The suggestions that have the most votes are chosen as part of the
      conference schedule for the following day.

      can still be presented as a five minute "Lightning Talk"

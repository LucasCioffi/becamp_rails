      On Friday evening, anyone in attendance has the opportunity
      to suggest topics for sessions for the following day. The
      suggester also indicates whether it is a topic they can
      present on, share information on, or want to learn. After
      all the suggestions have been written down, they are placed on
      a wall and all attendees can mark the suggestions they are interested
      in. The suggestions that have the most votes are chosen as part of the
      conference schedule the following day. Any topics that are not
      chosen can still be presented in the middle of the day as a five
      minute "Lightning Talk" segment where presenters can share their
      message with the other conference attendees.
